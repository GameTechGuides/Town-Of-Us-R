# Mind Control Ability Documentation

## Overview
The Mind Control ability allows players to temporarily take control of another player's character. This ability can be used strategically to influence the game's outcome by manipulating other players' actions.

## Usage
- **Activation**: The ability is activated by selecting a target player within a certain range.
- **Duration**: Once activated, the mind control effect lasts for a few seconds, during which the controller can move and act as the target player.
- **Cooldown**: After use, the ability goes on cooldown for a set period before it can be used again.

## Keybindings/UI Elements
- A unique icon appears on the player's UI when the Mind Control ability is available for use.
- Players can activate the ability by clicking on the icon and then selecting a target player.

## Side Effects and Limitations
- **Limited Range**: The ability can only be used on players within a certain distance.
- **Temporary Effect**: The control effect is temporary, and the target player regains control after the effect wears off.
- **Visibility**: Other players may notice unusual behavior during the mind control period, potentially revealing the controller's identity.

## Strategic Uses
- **Sabotage**: Force a player to perform sabotage actions, implicating them as a suspect.
- **Self-Preservation**: Use the ability to make another player perform risky actions, keeping yourself safe from suspicion.
- **Misdirection**: Create confusion and chaos by controlling players to act against their apparent interests.

Please note that the strategic use of the Mind Control ability requires careful timing and discretion to avoid detection and maximize its impact on the game.
